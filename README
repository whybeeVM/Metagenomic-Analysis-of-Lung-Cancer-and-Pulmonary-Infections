This repository contains original codes for major analyses in the manuscript 'Multimodal Metagenomic Analysis of Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid Enables Differential Diagnosis Between Lung Cancer and Pulmonary Infections'. All data are included in the 'data' directory. In each analysis folder, the codes for the major analyses are included.

This R script was used for building up classifiers.

File Annotation:

"mlr3_RandomForest.R" is the main R script.
"Infection_vs_Cancer_difftable.txt", "Bacteria_vs_Cancer_difftable.txt", "Fungi_vs_Cancer_difftable.txt" and "TE_vs_Cancer_difftable.txt" was differential features table. Host Gene and Transposable Elements(TE) expression were transformed into TPM. Microbial and bacteriophage were used relative abundances. Other features were remained orginal values.
"trainset_all.txt" was group annotation file of trainset between infection and lung cancer. "testset_all.txt" was group annotation file of validation set between infection and lung cancer. "trainset_subgroup.txt" was group annotation file of trainset among subgroup infection and lung cancer. "testset_subgroup.txt" was group annotation file of validation set among subgroup infection and lung cancer.
