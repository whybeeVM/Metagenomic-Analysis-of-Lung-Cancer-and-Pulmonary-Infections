This repository contains original codes for major analyses in the manuscript 'Multimodal Metagenomic Analysis of Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid Enables Differential Diagnosis Between Lung Cancer and Pulmonary Infections'. 
All data are included in the 'data' directory. In "pipeline" and "machine_learning_scripts" folders, the codes for the major analyses are included. The processed microbiome and host data for all 402 individuals are provided.  
All data published were accorded to Human Genetic Resources Administration of China regulation and to comply with informed consent.

####### pipeline ########

In our github folder kraken2_pipeline, it contains scripts to generate microbial matrix: 
01_data_preprocessing.sh, it used fastp to remove low quality and adaptor sequences.
02_rmhost.sh, it used BWA and samtools to remove reads mapped on hg38 reference genome.
03_kraken2_bracken.sh, it used kraken2 and bracken for microbial profiles calling.
04_relative_abudances_matrix.sh, it calculated relative abundances of all samples and summarized in species and genus levels.

Also, in folder RNAseq_pipeline, it contains scripts used for read mapping, gene expression quantification, and profile classification: 
01_data_preprocessing.sh, it used fastp to remove low quality and adaptor sequences as same as shell script in kraken2_pipeline.
02_map_to_reference_hg38.sh, it used HiSAT2 to mapping reads to hg38 reference genome.
03_featureCount.sh, it used featureCounts to call gene expression matrix for single sample. Also, it provided gene annotation file (gff) version ensure reproducibility of our results.
04_readcount_to_expression_profiles.sh, it combined all count table into one gene expression matrix.

######## data ########

We put all intermediate results into folders below:

CNV: copy number variants information table
Cell_proportion: immune cell proprotion table estimated by CIBERTSORT
DNA_micro: bacteria, fungi, viruses and bacteriophage relative abundance table from DNA data of all 402 clinical samples and Negative controls
RNA_micro: bacteria, fungi, viruses and bacteriophage relative abundance table from RNA data of all 402 clinical samples and Negative controls
RNA_EXP: host gene expression raw count table
TE_EXP: Transposable element expression raw count table

######## mechine_learning_script ########

In this folder, we put all meachine learning models building scripts, group annotaion file, input file, LASSO example script and assemble learning scripts in it.

input_file: all candidate features (CNV, DNA-micro, RNA-micro, Host(Gene expression/cell proportion), TE(transposable elements))of all comparisions
group_file: trainset.2: train set in two groups (pulmonary infection vs lung cancer); testset.2: test set in two groups (pulmonary infection vs lung cancer);
            trainset.4: train set in four groups (bacterial infection vs fungal infection vs TB vs lung cancer); testset.2: test set in four groups (bacterial infection vs fungal infection vs TB vs lung cancer).
example-lasso_DNA-Bacteria_vs_Cancer: please run "lasso-pipeline.sh". all R scripts were integrated in this shell script.
LASSO-scripts: please run "lasso-pipeline.sh". all R scripts were integrated in this shell script.
RF-scripts: please run "RandomForest-pipeline.sh". all R scripts were integrated in this shell script.
SVM-scripts: please run "SVM-pipeline.sh". all R scripts were integrated in this shell script.
XGboost-scripts: please run "XGBoost-pipeline.sh". all R scripts were integrated in this shell script.
Assemble_learning_scripts: file.txt contained real path of all results from four classifiers(LASSO,RF,SVM and XGboost); commandline: Rscript model_combined_addsenspe.R
